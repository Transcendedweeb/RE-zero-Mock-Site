        <h2>- Main Characters</h2>
        <h3>Natsuki Subaru</h3>
        <p>Natsuki Subaru is the main protagonist of Re:Zero Life in a Different World . He was a hikikomori that was transported to Lugnica through unknown means, and given the 
          ability to Return by Death by Satella. He officially became Emilia's knight following the incident at the Sanctuary and is later revealed to have the necessary qualities to become a Sage Candidate.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Emilia</h3>
        <p>The main hero, Emilia is a silver-haired half-elf girl and a Spirit Art User; she is one of the candidates to become the next ruler in the royal election, making her 42nd King of Lugunica.
          Subaru first meets her when her insignia, which she needs to possess in order to be eligible to participate in the election, is stolen by Felt. She is from the Frozen Forest, and is over a 
          hundred years old (although most of the time she was frozen in the forest). Her mental state is still that of a teenager. The name Emilia first used when introducing herself to Subaru, 
          "Satella", is also the name of the "Jealous Witch", whose appearance is said to resemble her own and is responsible for the discrimination against half-elves. Among the half breeds and other 
          discriminated or disenfranchised races and people in Lugunica, she is seen as their hope for a better future due to her ideal of democracy and better social equality. Because of her heritage 
          and resemblance to Satella, however, Emilia is often shunned and hated by most people, leaving her lonely and without any friends prior to meeting Subaru. Initially, she regards Subaru as a 
          mischievous child who always needs to be taken care of. After he risks his life to save her from the Witch's Cult, however, Emilia starts to develop deep feelings for him, as Subaru is the 
          first person to ever make her feel truly happy, accepted and loved.</p>

        
        <h3>Rem</h3>
        <p>One of the twin demons who work at Roswaal's mansion as maids, Rem is Ram's younger sister. She has blue hair which she wears parted on the left, and still has a full horn, which grants her 
          magical power. She does work at the mansion, although her ability to cook is better than her sister. She used to have an inferiority complex towards her sister. Bearing an intense hatred for 
          the Witch's Cult, Rem initially accused Subaru for having the Witch's scent, that resulted in her killing him twice. After Subaru saves her from the mabeasts of Elior Forest, becoming her "hero",
          Rem discards her suspicions and falls deeply in love with him, and even when he turns her down in favor of Emilia, she still becomes one of his most loyal followers. An extra story in Arc 3 of 
          the novel tells a "What If" story about what could've happened if Subaru and Rem had decided to run away instead; they lived happily ever after with two children.</p>

        
        <h3>Otto Suwen</h3>
        <p>A traveling merchant Subaru meets in Arc 3 en route to Roswaal's territory, who was drunk and down on his luck. While he can be somewhat skittish and cowardly he's generally a well meaning 
          person and very loyal to those who earned his friendship. In the light novel, he states out of all the candidates Otto supports Emilia the most because, like her, he is used to being misunderstood
          and treated badly for being different. He has a blessing that allows him to communicate with any animal, plant or being in the world. Unfortunately, this tends to unsettle people and makes him come 
          across as shady and sinister when it is in use. He joins Emilia's camp in Arc 4.</p>

        
        <h3>Echidna</h3>
        <p>She is the Witch of Greed. She is one of the primary characters in the fourth arc of the series. Echidna's curiosity toward the unknown and her thirst for knowledge are the two things that 
          define her behavior. She refers to it as love, and currently directs those feelings toward Subaru's Return by Death, which she is interested to the point that she longs to become his advisor to 
          record the many possibilities created from his ability. Described as being black hearted, she cannot understand the feelings of others, and can be seen as a sociopath by normal standards. If it 
          is to get a hold of more knowledge, she has no problems with employing sophistry, lying, and deceiving others. However, she interacts with ill will only toward three people in the world: Satella,
          Emilia, and one other person.</p>
