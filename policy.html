            <p>To ensure delivery of the desired products in the shortest lead time, we confirm and order from our supplier as quickly as possible after we 
                receive the order. Hence, any changes or cancellation of orders made after 3 days of order confirmation cause substantial disruption to the

                you of the approval or rejection of your refund. </p>
            
            <p class="bold">Late or missing refunds (if applicable)</p>
            <p>If you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account again. Then contact your credit card company, it may take some time before your 
                refund is officially posted. Next contact your bank. There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and 
                you still have not received your refund yet, please contact us. </p>
            
            <p class="bold">Shipping (more info at shipping tab)</p>
